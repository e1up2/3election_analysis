# 3election_analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee gave me the following task of completing the election audit of a recent local congresional selection.

1. Total number of votes cast
2. Complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Percentage of votes each candidate won
4. Total number of votes each candidate won
5. Winner of the election based on the popular vote

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.8.8, Visual Studio Code 1.60.1

## Summary
The analysis of this election shows that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockholm
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate's results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockholm received 23.05% of the vote and 85,213 votes
    - Diana Degette received 73.81% of the vote and 272,892 votes
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.14% of the vote and 11,606 votes
- The winner of the election was:
    - Candidate: Diana Degette, who received 73.81% of the vote and 272,892 votes

## Challenge Summary
While writing this code, I kept in mind that the election comission may want to use this same code to audit other types of elections and made it so that process was very simple. All I would have to do get the name of the csv file and insert that file name into my code. Please do not hesitate to ask me about auditing any other elections. It has been a pleasure working with the election commision!
